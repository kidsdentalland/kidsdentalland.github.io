      <description>KIDS DENTISTRY Kids Dental land conducts comprehensive examinations, including digital x-rays, and then diagnoses problems to prevent them from becoming serious. On a typical office visit to see one of our Doctors, your child will receive a dental cleaning and guidance on proper oral hygiene techniques. Many parents wonder when to bring their child for the first time. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends an initial dental examination by a child’s first birthday.</description>
